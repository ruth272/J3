## 1. Polymorphism: a situation where a variable that is declared can take on different types
Example: Ex3 in Polymorphism and Abstract Classes # 
## 2. Polymorphism allows the variable u to reference objects of different types.
## 3. Prints out "A"
## 4. Prints out "~~B~~" and "~~B~~"
## 5. Prints out "A" then "A" again
## 6. It won't compile because it is trying to call on getname as a private in subclass A but it is declared protected in the parent class.
## 7. Prints out "A: 1"
## 8. Prints out "foo1: B + B"
## 9. toString(breed), toString(species), toString(breed)
## 10. print out "42"
## 11. The abstract class can only be called through "super"
## 12. Abstract Class:
- make: to define the type of car
